# chromeahk-chatgpt-scraper
An open-source AHK script to automate Google Chrome to scrape chat messages from ChatGPT.

### Overview 
An AutoHotkey script to open a Chrome instance with a specific user profile, navigate to the ChatGPT website, wait for the page to load, enter text into the text box, and finally click the send button. It also checks if a captcha is present and clicks on it if necessary. However, it is discontinued because the website in question (https://chat.openai.com/) has limited the number of times users can access their service within an hour. This repository includes a Chrome.ahk file and uses various functions and methods to manipulate the browser and interact with the webpage.
